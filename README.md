## uva-string ##
use string and its function to solve some uva problems, the function used in string is listed as below:  

uva 1584 - Circular Sequence.cpp: size(), rotate()  

uva 353 - Pesky Palindromes.cpp: unique(), substr()  

uva 483 - Word Scramble.cpp: istringstream, reverse()  

uva 494 - Kindergarten Counting Game.cpp: getline() 

uva 1225 - Digit Counting.cpp: Originally, I want to use to_string, but I found it that my program can't be compiled after use to_string,   
so I use my own way to substitute to_string. (Chrome has it that some compiler does not compile to_string.)
